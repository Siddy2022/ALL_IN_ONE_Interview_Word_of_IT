C PROGRAM PRINT INTEGER
This c program first inputs an integer and then prints it. Input is done using scanf function and number is printed on screen using printf.

C programming code
 #include <stdio.h>
 #include<conio.h>
 void main()
  {
    int a;
    clrscr();
    printf("Enter an integer\n");
    scanf("%d", &a);
    printf("Integer that you have entered is %d\n", a);
    getch();
   }


C PROGRAM TO ADD TWO NUMBERS
C program to add two numbers: This c language program perform the basic arithmetic operation of addition on two numbers and then prints the sum on the screen. For example if the user entered two numbers as 5, 6 then 11 (5 + 6) will be printed on the screen.

C PROGRAMMING CODE
#include<stdio.h>
#include<conio.h>
void main()
{
   int a, b, c;
   printf("Enter two numbers to add\n");
   scanf("%d%d",&a,&b);
   c = a + b;
   printf("Sum of entered numbers = %d\n",c);
   getch();
}
ADDITION WITHOUT USING THIRD VARIABLE
#include<stdio.h>
#include<conio.h>
void main()
{
   int a = 1, b = 2;
   /* Storing result of addition in variable a */
    a = a + b;
  /* Not recommended because original value of a is lost 
   * and you may be using it somewhere in code considering it
   * as it was entered by the user.
   */
   printf("Sum of a and b = %d\n", a);
   getch();
}
C PROGRAM TO ADD TWO NUMBERS REPEATEDLY
#include<stdio.h>
#include<conio.h>
void main()
{
   int a, b, c;
   char ch;
   clrscr();
    while(1)
   {
      printf("Enter values of a and b\n");
      scanf("%d%d",&a,&b);
      c = a + b;
      printf("a + b = %d\n", c);
      printf("Do you wish to add more numbers(y/n)\n");
      scanf(" %c",&ch);
      if ( ch == 'y' || ch == 'Y' )
         continue;
      else
     break;
   }
  getch();
}
ADDING NUMBERS IN C USING FUNCTION
#include<stdio.h>
#include<conio.h>
long addition(long, long);
void main()
{
   long first, second, sum;
   scanf("%ld%ld", &first, &second);
   sum = addition(first, second);
   printf("%ld\n", sum);
   getch();
}
 long addition(long a, long b)
{
   long result;
   result = a + b;
   return result;
}

We have used long data type as it can handle large numbers, if you want to add still larger numbers which doesn't fit in long range then use array, string or other data structure. 


C PROGRAM TO CHECK ODD OR EVEN
c program to check odd or even: We will determine whether a number is odd or even by using different methods all are provided with a code in c language. As you have study in mathematics that in decimal number system even numbers are divisible by 2 while odd are not so we may use modulus operator(%) which returns remainder, For example 4%3 gives 1 ( remainder when four is divided by three). Even numbers are of the form 2*p and odd are of the form (2*p+1) where p is is an integer.

C program to check odd or even using modulus operator
#include<stdio.h>
#include<conio.h>
void main()
{
   int n;
   printf("Enter an integer\n");
   scanf("%d",&n);
   if ( n%2 == 0 )
   printf("Even\n");
   else
   printf("Odd\n");
   getch();
}

We can use bitwise AND (&) operator to check odd or even, as an example consider binary of 7 (0111) when we perform 7 & 1 the result will be one and you may observe that the least significant bit of every odd number is 1, so ( odd_number & 1 ) will be one always and also ( even_number & 1 ) is zero.

C program to check odd or even using bitwise operator
#include<stdio.h>
#include<conio.h>
void main()
{
   int n;
   printf("Enter an integer\n");
   scanf("%d",&n);
   if ( n & 1 == 1 )
   printf("Odd\n");
   else
   printf("Even\n");
   getch();
}
FIND ODD OR EVEN USING CONDITIONAL OPERATOR
#include<stdio.h>
#include<conio.h>
void main()
{
   int n;
   clrscr();
   printf("Input an integer\n");
   scanf("%d",&n);
   n%2 == 0 ? printf("Even\n") : printf("Odd\n");
   getch();
}

C program to check odd or even without using bitwise or modulus operator
#include<stdio.h>
#include<conio.h>
void main()
{
   int n;
   printf("Enter an integer\n");
   scanf("%d",&n);
   if ( (n/2)*2 == n )
   printf("Even\n");
   else
   printf("Odd\n");
   getch();
} 

In c programming language when we divide two integers we get an integer result, For example the result of 7/3 will be 2.So we can take advantage of this and may use it to find whether the number is odd or even. Consider an integer n we can first divide by 2 and then multiply it by 2 if the result is the original number then the number is even otherwise the number is odd. For example 11/2 = 5, 5*2 = 10 ( which is not equal to eleven), now consider 12/2 = 6 and 6 *2 = 12 ( same as original number). These are some logic which may help you in finding if a number is odd or not. 


C PROGRAM TO CHECK WHETHER INPUT ALPHABET IS A VOWEL OR NOT
This code checks whether an input alphabet is a vowel or not. Both lower-case and upper-case are checked.

C programming code
#include <stdio.h>

  printf("Enter a character\n");
  scanf("%c", &ch);
  if (ch == 'a' || ch == 'A' || ch == 'e' || ch == 'E' || ch == 'i' || ch == 'I'   || ch =='o' || ch=='O' || ch == 'u' || ch == 'U')
  printf("%c is a vowel.\n", ch);
  else
  printf("%c is not a vowel.\n", ch);
  getch();
}

Check vowel using switch statement
#include <stdio.h>
#include<conio.h>
void main()
{
  char ch;
  printf("Input a character\n");
  scanf("%c", &ch);
  switch(ch)
  {
    case 'a':

    case 'E':
    case 'i':
    case 'I':
    case 'o':
    case 'O':
    case 'u':
    case 'U':
      printf("%c is a vowel.\n", ch);
      break;
    default:
      printf("%c is not a vowel.\n", ch);
  }             
   getch();
}
FUNCTION TO CHECK VOWEL

int check_vowel(char a)
{
    if (a >= 'A' && a <= 'Z')
    a = a + 'a' - 'A';   /* Converting to lower case or use a = a + 32 */
    if (a == 'a' || a == 'e' || a == 'i' || a == 'o' || a == 'u')
       return 1;
       return 0;
}


C PROGRAM TO CHECK LEAP YEAR
C program to check leap year: c code to check leap year, year will be entered by the user.

C programming code
#include <stdio.h>
#include<conio.h> 
void main()
{
  int year;
  printf("Enter a year to check if it is a leap year\n");
  scanf("%d", &year);
  if ( year%400 == 0)
    printf("%d is a leap year.\n", year);
  else if ( year%100 == 0)
    printf("%d is not a leap year.\n", year);
  else if ( year%4 == 0 )
    printf("%d is a leap year.\n", year);
  else
    printf("%d is not a leap year.\n", year);  
   getch();
}


ADD DIGITS OF NUMBER IN C
C program to add digits of a number: Here we are using modulus operator(%) to extract individual digits of number and adding them.

C programming code
#include <stdio.h>
#include<conio.h>
void main()
{
   int n, sum = 0, remainder;
   printf("Enter an integer\n");
   scanf("%d",&n);
   while(n != 0)
   {
      remainder = n % 10;
      sum = sum + remainder;
      n = n / 10;
   }
  printf("Sum of digits of entered number = %d\n",sum);
  getch();
}
FOR EXAMPLE IF THE INPUT IS 98, SUM(VARIABLE) IS 0 INITIALLY
98%10 = 8 (% is modulus operator which gives us remainder when 98 is divided by 10).
sum = sum + remainder
so sum = 8 now.
98/10 = 9 because in c whenever we divide integer by another integer we get an integer.
9%10 = 9
sum = 8(previous value) + 9
sum = 17
9/10 = 0.So finally n = 0, loop ends we get the required sum. 


ADD DIGITS USING RECURSION
#include <stdio.h>
#include<conio.h>
int add_digits(int);
void main() 
{
  int n, result;
  scanf("%d", &n);
  result = add_digits(n);
  printf("%d\n", result);
  getch();
}
 int add_digits(int n)  
{
  static int sum = 0;
   if (n == 0) {
   return 0;
  }
  sum = n%10 + add_digits(n/10);
  return sum;
}

C - VARIABLES
A variable is nothing but a name given to a storage area that our programs can manipulate. Each variable in C has a specific type, which determines the size and layout of the variable's memory; the range of values that can be stored within that memory; and the set of operations that can be applied to the variable.
The name of a variable can be composed of letters, digits, and the underscore character. It must begin with either a letter or an underscore. Upper and lowercase letters are distinct because C is case-sensitive. Based on the basic types explained in previous chapter, there will be the following basic variable types:
Type	Description
char	Typically a single octet(one byte). This is an integer type.
int	The most natural size of integer for the machine.
float	A single-precision floating point value.
double	A double-precision floating point value.
void	Represents the absence of type.
C programming language also allows to define various other types of variables, which we will cover in subsequent chapters like Enumeration, Pointer, Array, Structure, Union, etc. For this chapter, let us study only basic variable types.
VARIABLE DEFINITION IN C:
A variable definition means to tell the compiler where and how much to create the storage for the variable. A variable definition specifies a data type and contains a list of one or more variables of that type as follows:
type variable_list;
Here, type must be a valid C data type including char, w_char, int, float, double, bool or any user-defined object, etc., and variable_list may consist of one or more identifier names separated by commas. Some valid declarations are shown here:
int    i, j, k;
char   c, ch;
float  f, salary;
double d;
The line int i, j, k; both declares and defines the variables i, j and k; which instructs the compiler to create variables named i, j and k of type int.
Variables can be initialized (assigned an initial value) in their declaration. The initializer consists of an equal sign followed by a constant expression as follows:
type variable_name = value;
Some examples are:
extern int d = 3, f = 5;    // declaration of d and f. 
int d = 3, f = 5;           // definition and initializing d and f. 
byte z = 22;                // definition and initializes z. 
char x = 'x';               // the variable x has the value 'x'.
For definition without an initializer: variables with static storage duration are implicitly initialized with NULL (all bytes have the value 0); the initial value of all other variables is undefined.
VARIABLE DECLARATION IN C:
A variable declaration provides assurance to the compiler that there is one variable existing with the given type and name so that compiler proceed for further compilation without needing complete detail about the variable. A variable declaration has its meaning at the time of compilation only, compiler needs actual variable declaration at the time of linking of the program.
A variable declaration is useful when you are using multiple files and you define your variable in one of the files which will be available at the time of linking of the program. You will use extern keyword to declare a variable at any place. Though you can declare a variable multiple times in your C program but it can be defined only once in a file, a function or a block of code.
EXAMPLE
Try following example, where variables have been declared at the top, but they have been defined and initialized inside the main function
#include <stdio.h>
#include<conio.h>
// Variable declaration:
extern int a, b;
extern int c;
extern float f;
void main ()
{
  /* variable definition: */
  int a, b;
  int c;
  float f;
  /* actual initialization */
  a = 10;
  b = 20;
  c = a + b;
  printf("value of c : %d \n", c);
  f = 70.0/3.0;
  printf("value of f : %f \n", f);
  getch();
}
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result:
value of c : 30
value of f : 23.333334
Same concept applies on function declaration where you provide a function name at the time of its declaration and its actual definition can be given anywhere else. For example:
// function declaration
int func();
void main()
{
    // function call
    int i = func();
}

// function definition
int func()
{
 return 0;
}
LVALUES AND RVALUES IN C:
There are two kinds of expressions in C:
lvalue : An expression that is an lvalue may appear as either the left-hand or right-hand side of an assignment.
rvalue : An expression that is an rvalue may appear on the right- but not left-hand side of an assignment.
Variables are lvalues and so may appear on the left-hand side of an assignment. Numeric literals are rvalues and so may not be assigned and can not appear on the left-hand side. Following is a valid statement:
int g = 20;
But following is not a valid statement and would generate compile-time error:
10 = 20;


C - CONSTANTS AND LITERALS
The constants refer to fixed values that the program may not alter during its execution. These fixed values are also called literals.
Constants can be of any of the basic data types like an integer constant, a floating constant, a character constant, or a string literal. There are also enumeration constants as well.
The constants are treated just like regular variables except that their values cannot be modified after their definition.
INTEGER LITERALS
An integer literal can be a decimal, octal, or hexadecimal constant. A prefix specifies the base or radix: 0x or 0X for hexadecimal, 0 for octal, and nothing for decimal.
An integer literal can also have a suffix that is a combination of U and L, for unsigned and long, respectively. The suffix can be uppercase or lowercase and can be in any order.
Here are some examples of integer literals:
212         /* Legal */
215u        /* Legal */
0xFeeL      /* Legal */
078         /* Illegal: 8 is not an octal digit */
032UU       /* Illegal: cannot repeat a suffix */
Following are other examples of various type of Integer literals:
85         /* decimal */
0213       /* octal */
0x4b       /* hexadecimal */
30         /* int */
30u        /* unsigned int */
30l        /* long */
30ul       /* unsigned long */
FLOATING-POINT LITERALS
A floating-point literal has an integer part, a decimal point, a fractional part, and an exponent part. You can represent floating point literals either in decimal form or exponential form.
While representing using decimal form, you must include the decimal point, the exponent, or both and while representing using exponential form, you must include the integer part, the fractional part, or both. The signed exponent is introduced by e or E.
Here are some examples of floating-point literals:
3.14159       /* Legal */
314159E-5L    /* Legal */
510E          /* Illegal: incomplete exponent */
210f          /* Illegal: no decimal or exponent */
.e55          /* Illegal: missing integer or fraction */
CHARACTER CONSTANTS
Character literals are enclosed in single quotes, e.g., 'x' and can be stored in a simple variable of chartype.
A character literal can be a plain character (e.g., 'x'), an escape sequence (e.g., '\t'), or a universal character (e.g., '\u02C0').
There are certain characters in C when they are preceded by a backslash they will have special meaning and they are used to represent like newline (\n) or tab (\t). Here, you have a list of some of such escape sequence codes:
Escape sequence	Meaning
\\	\ character
\'	' character
\"	" character
\?	? character
\a	Alert or bell
\b	Backspace
\f	Form feed
\n	Newline
\r	Carriage return
\t	Horizontal tab
\v	Vertical tab
\ooo	Octal number of one to three digits
\xhh . . .	Hexadecimal number of one or more digits
Following is the example to show few escape sequence characters:
#include <stdio.h>
#include<conio.h>
void main()
{
   printf("Hello\tWorld\n\n");
   getch();
}
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result:
Hello   World

STRING LITERALS
String literals or constants are enclosed in double quotes "". A string contains characters that are similar to character literals: plain characters, escape sequences, and universal characters.
You can break a long line into multiple lines using string literals and separating them using whitespaces.
Here are some examples of string literals. All the three forms are identical strings.

"hello, " "d" "ear"
DEFINING CONSTANTS
There are two simple ways in C to define constants:
Using #define preprocessor.
Using const keyword.
THE #DEFINE PREPROCESSOR
Following is the form to use #define preprocessor to define a constant:
#define identifier value
Following example explains it in detail:
#include <stdio.h>
#include<conio.h>
#define LENGTH 10   
#define WIDTH  5
void main()
{
 int area;  
 area = LENGTH * WIDTH;
 printf("value of area : %d", area);
 getch();
}
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result:
value of area : 50
THE CONST KEYWORD
You can use const prefix to declare constants with a specific type as follows:
const type variable = value;
Following example explains it in detail:
#include <stdio.h>
#include<conio.h>
void main()
{
   const int  LENGTH = 10;
   const int  WIDTH  = 5;
   int area;  
   area = LENGTH * WIDTH;
   printf("value of area : %d", area);
   getch();
}
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result:
value of area : 50
Note that it is a good programming practice to define constants in CAPITALS.



C - OPERATORS
An operator is a symbol that tells the compiler to perform specific mathematical or logical manipulations. C language is rich in built-in operators and provides the following types of operators:
Arithmetic Operators
Relational Operators
Logical Operators
Bitwise Operators
Assignment Operators
Misc Operators
This tutorial will explain the arithmetic, relational, logical, bitwise, assignment and other operators one by one.
ARITHMETIC OPERATORS
Following table shows all the arithmetic operators supported by C language. Assume variable A holds 10 and variable B holds 20 then:
Operator	Description	Example
+	Adds two operands	A + B will give 30
-	Subtracts second operand from the first	A - B will give -10
*	Multiplies both operands	A * B will give 200
/	Divides numerator by de-numerator	B / A will give 2
%	Modulus Operator and remainder of after an integer division	B % A will give 0
++	Increments operator increases integer value by one	A++ will give 11
--	Decrements operator decreases integer value by one	A-- will give 9
RELATIONAL OPERATORS
Following table shows all the relational operators supported by C language. Assume variable A holds 10 and variable B holds 20, then:
Operator	Description	Example
==	Checks if the values of two operands are equal or not, if yes then condition becomes true.	(A == B) is not true.
!=	Checks if the values of two operands are equal or not, if values are not equal then condition becomes true.	(A != B) is true.
>	Checks if the value of left operand is greater than the value of right operand, if yes then condition becomes true.	(A > B) is not true.
<	Checks if the value of left operand is less than the value of right operand, if yes then condition becomes true.	(A < B) is true.
>=	Checks if the value of left operand is greater than or equal to the value of right operand, if yes then condition becomes true.	(A >= B) is not true.
<=	Checks if the value of left operand is less than or equal to the value of right operand, if yes then condition becomes true.	(A <= B) is true.
LOGICAL OPERATORS
Following table shows all the logical operators supported by C language. Assume variable A holds 1 and variable B holds 0, then:
Operator	Description	Example
&&	Called Logical AND operator. If both the operands are non-zero, then condition becomes true.	(A && B) is false.
||	Called Logical OR Operator. If any of the two operands is non-zero, then condition becomes true.	(A || B) is true.
!	Called Logical NOT Operator. Use to reverses the logical state of its operand. If a condition is true then Logical NOT operator will make false.	!(A && B) is true.
BITWISE OPERATORS
Bitwise operator works on bits and perform bit-by-bit operation. The truth tables for &, |, and ^ are as follows:
p	q	p & q	p | q	p ^ q
0	0	0	0	0
0	1	0	1	1
1	1	1	1	0
1	0	0	1	1
Assume if A = 60; and B = 13; now in binary format they will be as follows:
A = 0011 1100
B = 0000 1101
-----------------
A&B = 0000 1100
A|B = 0011 1101
A^B = 0011 0001
~A  = 1100 0011
The Bitwise operators supported by C language are listed in the following table. Assume variable A holds 60 and variable B holds 13, then:
Operator	Description	Example
&	Binary AND Operator copies a bit to the result if it exists in both operands.	(A & B) will give 12, which is 0000 1100
|	Binary OR Operator copies a bit if it exists in either operand.	(A | B) will give 61, which is 0011 1101
^	Binary XOR Operator copies the bit if it is set in one operand but not both.	(A ^ B) will give 49, which is 0011 0001
~	Binary Ones Complement Operator is unary and has the effect of 'flipping' bits.	(~A ) will give -61, which is 1100 0011 in 2's complement form.
<<	Binary Left Shift Operator. The left operands value is moved left by the number of bits specified by the right operand.	A << 2 will give 240 which is 1111 0000
>>	Binary Right Shift Operator. The left operands value is moved right by the number of bits specified by the right operand.	A >> 2 will give 15 which is 0000 1111
ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS
There are following assignment operators supported by C language:
Operator	Description	Example
=	Simple assignment operator, Assigns values from right side operands to left side operand	C = A + B will assign value of A + B into C
+=	Add AND assignment operator, It adds right operand to the left operand and assign the result to left operand	C += A is equivalent to C = C + A
-=	Subtract AND assignment operator, It subtracts right operand from the left operand and assign the result to left operand	C -= A is equivalent to C = C - A
*=	Multiply AND assignment operator, It multiplies right operand with the left operand and assign the result to left operand	C *= A is equivalent to C = C * A
/=	Divide AND assignment operator, It divides left operand with the right operand and assign the result to left operand	C /= A is equivalent to C = C / A
%=	Modulus AND assignment operator, It takes modulus using two operands and assign the result to left operand	C %= A is equivalent to C = C % A
<<=	Left shift AND assignment operator	C <<= 2 is same as C = C << 2
>>=	Right shift AND assignment operator	C >>= 2 is same as C = C >> 2
&=	Bitwise AND assignment operator	C &= 2 is same as C = C & 2
^=	bitwise exclusive OR and assignment operator	C ^= 2 is same as C = C ^ 2
|=	bitwise inclusive OR and assignment operator	C |= 2 is same as C = C | 2
MISC OPERATORS ? SIZEOF & TERNARY
There are few other important operators including sizeof and ? : supported by C Language.
Operator	Description	Example
sizeof()	Returns the size of an variable.	sizeof(a), where a is integer, will return 4.
&	Returns the address of an variable.	&a; will give actual address of the variable.
*	Pointer to a variable.	*a; will pointer to a variable.
? :	Conditional Expression	If Condition is true ? Then value X : Otherwise value Y
OPERATORS PRECEDENCE IN C
Operator precedence determines the grouping of terms in an expression. This affects how an expression is evaluated. Certain operators have higher precedence than others; for example, the multiplication operator has higher precedence than the addition operator.
For example x = 7 + 3 * 2; here, x is assigned 13, not 20 because operator * has higher precedence than +, so it first gets multiplied with 3*2 and then adds into 7.
Here, operators with the highest precedence appear at the top of the table, those with the lowest appear at the bottom. Within an expression, higher precedence operators will be evaluated first.
Category 	Operator 	Associativity 
Postfix 	() [] -> . ++ - -  	Left to right 
Unary 	+ - ! ~ ++ - - (type)* & sizeof 	Right to left 
Multiplicative  	* / % 	Left to right

FUNCTION
A function is a group of statements that together perform a task. Every C program has at least one function, which is main(), and all the most trivial programs can define additional functions.
You can divide up your code into separate functions. How you divide up your code among different functions is up to you, but logically the division usually is so each function performs a specific task.
A function declaration tells the compiler about a function's name, return type, and parameters. A function definition provides the actual body of the function.
The C standard library provides numerous built-in functions that your program can call. For example, function strcat() to concatenate two strings, function memcpy() to copy one memory location to another location and many more functions.
A function is known with various names like a method or a sub-routine or a procedure, etc.
DEFINING A FUNCTION:
The general form of a function definition in C programming language is as follows:
return_type function_name( parameter list )
{
   body of the function
}
A function definition in C programming language consists of a function header and a function body. Here are all the parts of a function:
Return Type: A function may return a value. The return_type is the data type of the value the function returns. Some functions perform the desired operations without returning a value. In this case, the return_type is the keyword void.
Function Name: This is the actual name of the function. The function name and the parameter list together constitute the function signature.
Parameters: A parameter is like a placeholder. When a function is invoked, you pass a value to the parameter. This value is referred to as actual parameter or argument. The parameter list refers to the type, order, and number of the parameters of a function. Parameters are optional; that is, a function may contain no parameters.
Function Body: The function body contains a collection of statements that define what the function does.
EXAMPLE:
Following is the source code for a function called max(). This function takes two parameters num1 and num2 and returns the maximum between the two:
/* function returning the max between two numbers */
int max(int num1, int num2) 
{
   /* local variable declaration */
   int result;
   if (num1 > num2)
      result = num1;
   else
      result = num2;
   return result; 
}
FUNCTION DECLARATIONS:
A function declaration tells the compiler about a function name and how to call the function. The actual body of the function can be defined separately.
A function declaration has the following parts:
return_type function_name( parameter list );
For the above defined function max(), following is the function declaration:
int max(int num1, int num2);
Parameter names are not important in function declaration only their type is required, so following is also valid declaration:
int max(int, int);
Function declaration is required when you define a function in one source file and you call that function in another file. In such case you should declare the function at the top of the file calling the function.
CALLING A FUNCTION:
While creating a C function, you give a definition of what the function has to do. To use a function, you will have to call that function to perform the defined task.
When a program calls a function, program control is transferred to the called function. A called function performs defined task and when its return statement is executed or when its function-ending closing brace is reached, it returns program control back to the main program.
To call a function, you simply need to pass the required parameters along with function name, and if function returns a value, then you can store returned value. For example:
#include <stdio.h>
#include<conio.h> 
/* function declaration */
int max(int num1, int num2);
void main ()
{
 /* local variable definition */
   int a = 100;
   int b = 200;
   int ret;
 /* calling a function to get max value */
   ret = max(a, b);
   printf( "Max value is : %d\n", ret );
   getch();
}
 
/* function returning the max between two numbers */
int max(int num1, int num2) 
{
   /* local variable declaration */
   int result;
   if (num1 > num2)
      result = num1;
   else
      result = num2;
   return result; 
}
I kept max() function along with main() function and compiled the source code. While running final executable, it would produce the following result:
Max value is : 200
FUNCTION ARGUMENTS:
If a function is to use arguments, it must declare variables that accept the values of the arguments. These variables are called the formal parameters of the function.
The formal parameters behave like other local variables inside the function and are created upon entry into the function and destroyed upon exit.
While calling a function, there are two ways that arguments can be passed to a function:
Call Type	Description
Call by value	This method copies the actual value of an argument into the formal parameter of the function. In this case, changes made to the parameter inside the function have no effect on the argument.
Call by reference	This method copies the address of an argument into the formal parameter. Inside the function, the address is used to access the actual argument used in the call. This means that changes made to the parameter affect the argument.
By default, C uses call by value to pass arguments. In general, this means that code within a function cannot alter the arguments used to call the function and above mentioned example while calling max() function used the same method.



POINTER
C Pointer is used to allocate memory dynamically i.e. at run time.
C Pointer is a variable that stores the address of another variable.
The variable might be any of the data type such as int, float, char, double, short etc.
Syntax : data_type *var_name;Example : int *p;  char *p;
Where, * is used to denote that “p” is pointer variable and not a normal variable.
Key points to remember about pointers in C:
Normal variable stores the value whereas pointer variable stores the address of the variable.
The content of the C pointer always be a whole number i.e. address.
Always C pointer is initialized to null, i.e. int *p = null.
The value of null pointer is 0.
& symbol is used to get the address of the variable.
* symbol is used to get the value of the variable that a pointer is pointing to.
If pointer is assigned to NULL, it means it is pointing to nothing.
Two pointers can be subtracted to know how many elements are available between these two pointers.
But, Pointer addition, multiplication, division are not allowed.
The size of any pointer is 2 byte (for 16 bit compiler).
Example program for pointer in C:

#include <stdio.h>
#include<conio.h> 
void main()
{
   int *ptr, q;
    q = 50;  
    /* address of q is assigned to ptr  */
    ptr = &q;    
    /* display q's value using ptr variable */      
    printf("%d", *ptr);
    getch();
}
Output:
50



KEYWORD
C keeps a small set of keywords for its own use. These keywords cannot be used as identifiers in the program — a common restriction with modern languages. Where users of Old C may be surprised is in the introduction of some new keywords; if those names were used as identifiers in previous programs, then the programs will have to be changed. It will be easy to spot, because it will provoke your compiler into telling you about invalid names for things. Here is the list of keywords used in Standard C; you will notice that none of them use upper-case letters.



auto	double	  int	  struct
break	else	  long	  switch
case	enum    	  register	  typedef
char	extern	  return	  union
const	float	  short	  unsigned
continue	for	  signed	  void
default	goto	  sizeof	  volatile
do	if	  static	  while

The new keywords that are likely to surprise old programmers are: const, signed, void and volatile (although void has been around for a while). Eagle eyed readers may have noticed that some implementations of C used to use the keywords entry, asm, and fortran. These are not part of the Standard, and few will mourn them.


FACTORIAL PROGRAM IN C
Factorial program in c: c code to find and print factorial of a number, three methods are given, first one uses for loop, second uses a function to find factorial and third using recursion. Factorial is represented using '!', so five factorial will be written as (5!), n factorial as (n!). Also
n! = n*(n-1)*(n-2)*(n-3)...3.2.1 and zero factorial is defined as one i.e. 0! = 1.
FACTORIAL PROGRAM IN C USING FOR LOOP
#include <stdio.h>
#includde<conio.h>
void main()
{
  int c, n, fact = 1;
  printf("Enter a number to calculate it's factorial\n");
  scanf("%d", &n);
  for (c = 1; c <= n; c++)
  fact = fact * c;
  printf("Factorial of %d = %d\n", n, fact);
  getch();
}
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FACTORIAL PROGRAM IN C USING FUNCTION

#include <stdio.h>
#include<conio.h>
long factorial(int);
void main()
{
  int number;
  long fact = 1;
  printf("Enter a number to calculate it's factorial\n");
  scanf("%d", &number);
  printf("%d! = %ld\n", number, factorial(number));
  getch();
}
 long factorial(int n)
{
  int c;
  long result = 1;
  for (c = 1; c <= n; c++)
  result = result * c;
  return result;
}
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FACTORIAL PROGRAM IN C USING RECURSION
#include<stdio.h>
#include<conio.h>
long factorial(int);
void main()
{
  int n;
  long f;
  printf("Enter an integer to find factorial\n");
  scanf("%d", &n);
  if (n < 0)
    printf("Negative integers are not allowed.\n");
  else
  {
    f = factorial(n);
    printf("%d! = %ld\n", n, f);
  }
    getch();
}
 long factorial(int n)
{
  if (n == 0)
  return 1;
  else
   return(n * factorial(n-1));
}
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Recursion is a technique in which a function calls itself, for example in above code factorial function is calling itself. To solve a problem using recursion you must first express its solution in recursive form.

DECIMAL TO BINARY CONVERSION
C program to convert decimal to binary: c language code to convert an integer from decimal number system(base-10) to binary number system(base-2). Size of integer is assumed to be 32 bits. We use bitwise operators to perform the desired task. We right shift the original number by 31, 30, 29, ..., 1, 0 bits using a loop and bitwise AND the number obtained with 1(one), if the result is 1 then that bit is 1 otherwise it is 0(zero).
C PROGRAMMING CODE
#include <stdio.h>
#include<conio.h> 
void main()
{
  int n, c, k;
  printf("Enter an integer in decimal number system\n");
  scanf("%d", &n);
  printf("%d in binary number system is:\n", n);
  for (c = 31; c >= 0; c--)
  {
    k = n >> c;
    if (k & 1)
      printf("1");
    else
      printf("0");
  }
  printf("\n");
  getch();
}

Above code only prints binary of integer, but we may wish to perform operations on binary so in the code below we are storing the binary in a string. We create a function which returns a pointer to string which is the binary of the number passed as argument to the function.

   int n, c, k;
   char *pointer;
   printf("Enter an integer in decimal number system\n");
   scanf("%d",&n);
   pointer = decimal_to_binary(n);
   printf("Binary string of %d is: %s\n", n, t);
   free(pointer);
   getch();
}
 char *decimal_to_binary(int n)
{
   int c, d, count;
   char *pointer;
   count = 0;
   pointer = (char*)malloc(32+1);

   exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
   for ( c = 31 ; c >= 0 ; c-- )
   {
      d = n >> c;
      if ( d & 1 )
         *(pointer+count) = 1 + '0';
      else
         *(pointer+count) = 0 + '0';
      count++;
   }
   *(pointer+count) = '\0';

C PROGRAM TO REVERSE A NUMBER
C Program to reverse a number :- This program reverse the number entered by the user and then prints the reversed number on the screen. For example if user enter 123 as input then 321 is printed as output. In our program we use modulus(%) operator to obtain the digits of a number. To invert number look at it and write it from opposite direction or the output of code is a number obtained by writing original number from right to left. To reverse or invert large numbers use long data type or long long data type if your compiler supports it, if you still have large numbers then use strings or other data structure.


C PROGRAMMING CODE
#include <stdio.h>
#include<conio.h> 
void main()

PALINDROME NUMBERS
PALINDROME NUMBER ALGORITHM
1. Get the number from user.
