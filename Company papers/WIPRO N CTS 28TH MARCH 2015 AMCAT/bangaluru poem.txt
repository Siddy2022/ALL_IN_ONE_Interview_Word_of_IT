
You will enjoy this poem,

Bengaluru is rich,
 Bengaluru is poor.
 Bengaluru is fast,
 Bengaluru is slow.


Little bit sweet,
 and little bit sour.

Sometimes it's hot
 but not too cold. 

Mornings r energetic
 & evenings r electric.

Noons r lazy but
 Nights r crazy..

And any one U ask,
 he always say "B busy"
 Dude, life n Bengaluru 
 Is not so easy...! 

There is lot of Masti with
 little bit of Maska...

Welcome to the city that 
 can't live, w/out celebration !

Sev puri, Vada Pav and bhel puri
 are all Bengaluru chaat..
 Relishing it with spicy chutney is no easy art..

From popcorn to ice-cream, all sold on cart,

Bengaluru o Bengaluru you're always close to my heart.!

Where Tamtam
 usually run on time,
 And violently rushing
 for a seat is not a crime.

Here 3 PM for lunch and
 12 AM to dine,

People face hardships,
 but still say "it's fine".!

Kannada, telagu,tamil, Marathi, Punjabi, 
 Everyone together celebrate Christmas and Diwali,

Holi is colorful and Ramzan is cheerful,

Spend some time here and your life will be unforgetful.!

Billionaire to beggars,
 all found in this city,
 Be careful dude,
 this place is a bit witty..,

Overall this dream world
 is huge but pretty,
 Bengaluru
 you're wonderful city.

 Because...
 she is like mother to millions.

That's Namma Bengaluru
 Dedicated to all Bengalureans !
